## Hardening laptop with WINDOWS 10 
#### (based on https://hardenwindows10forsecurity.com/)

The main principle is **Least Privilege**. To implement the principle of least privilege is to configure your system so that it only does what you normally do, and nothing else.
This minimizes the attack surface, and removes services that listen on the network 24/7 to anybody who wants to send it stuff.(like an exploit) 

**Good security consists of deter, deny, delay and detection. Hardening covers the first 3.**

It is important to note, that after hardening a system, one has to test to see if the applications that you run still runs as expected. The ideal candidate of this project is a home user with no need for communications among PCs in the LAN. That is because the more network ports you open, the less secure you become.

If your system has already been compromised, the best course of action is to re-install Windows. Because there is no telling what backdoors and botnets clients have been installed on your system. You cannot fight back at someone who already has administrator control of your system. You can implement something and they will just disable it. You best chance of survival is to re-install Windows and then hardening it to prevent further attacks from happening.

### WSUS Offline
http://www.wsusoffline.net/
Since the release of Windows 10 on Windows Insider, there has been critical updates that could stop you from performing Windows Check for Updates. If you have attackers on your tail, you may very well be stopped from obtaining critical updates. Or that you may be compromised when you go online to fetch updates.

There is a free tool called WSUS Offline Update, which can download updates for all Windows platforms and create a ISO image file.

This tool eliminates a critical gap in Windows installation. That is when you only have the latest version but are missing all updates.
**So the plan is to run this tool on another PC to fetch the updates, and take the updates disc to the machine you are installing.**


### Install Antivirus
Or use Windows Defender

### Least Privilage
One of the first things you should do in line with least privilege is to create a Standard user account, and use that account for your daily work. Only login to the administrative account to install programs, configure networking, or do system maintenance tasks. Because when you are working in a Standard account, any malware or hacker that makes it onto your system will inherit your privilege and not have admin privileges to make system wide modifications. 

Control Panel -> All Control Panel Items -> User Accounts -> Change User Account Control Settings

### Firewall profile
Control Panel -> Network and Sharing Center

When you plug in the ethernet cable or connect to WiFi after hardening, set network to Public, which is the most restrictive and secure.

### Disable IPV6 Totally

### Disabling Listening Ports
When you run the command 'netstat -abn', it will show you which ports are open and listening to the network. Normally, you would want to close those ports unless you really need them. Windows 10's listening processes and their port numbers are RPCss ( 135 ), eventlog service ( 49409 ), Spoolsv ( 49410 ), schedule ( 49411 ), lsass.exe ( 49414 ).

### Router and Hardware Firewalls
Buy a router that has Stateful Packet Inspection ( SPI ) firewall

### Windows Advanced Firewall, turn on outbound blocking and logging
Window's firewall's default policy is set to inbound deny and outbound allow all. 
Most people don't know that you have to turn outbound blocking on. When outbound blocking is turned on, it only allows the programs and services you specify to talk to the net. Malware will have a hard time reporting back to their servers. However, it is missing a feature that tells you what programs it has blocked outbound. There is a free add-on called **BiniSoft Windows Firewall Control** that can solve this problem. 

Windows Firewall doesn't notify you when an application calls outbound when outbound policy is block. BiniSoft Windows Firewall Control is an add on app that gives you that feature. It is also particular useful also to have it create a 'temporary rule' for the times when you use web based program installers. You get this in their notification pop up.

### Delivery Optimization
Delivery Optimization is designed to save bandwidth when performing Windows Update. It caches the update for a short period and sends them over to another PC in the LAN. You can stop update downloads from other PCs so that you trust only Windows Update

### Set up a Microsoft Account
Setting up the system to use a MS Account for login is needed if you plan to do purchases through the Windows app Store.

However, it is not recommended that your admin account be an MS account, because it is exposed on the net on Outlook.com and allows attackers to crack your password before even touching your network or your computer

### Software Restriction Policy
When activated, Software Restriction Policy will prevent any program from running except if it is residing in \Program Files or \Windows. That means any downloaded malware in Temporary Internet Files or elsewhere will not be able to run. ( browsers and plug-ins sometimes have vulnerabilities to let infected web sites to force them to download ) Since you will be running as a standard user daily, that malware cannot install itself to the above 2 locations, because you need admin rights to do so. So you are covered against unwanted Desktop programs running.

Feature not available in Windows 10 Home.

**Simple SRP 2.1** is a free tool that provides the majority of the functionality of Windows’ own SRP in a small program that sits in the systray. And it works on Windows 10 64bit.

### Turn on Ransomware Protection
Windows Defender > Virus & Threat Protection > Ransomware Protection > Manage ransomware protection > Controlled Folder Access=On

### Stop Distributed COM
Distributed COM ( or DCOM ) was invented by MS to answer the perceived need to enable distributed computing. At one time, this was all the rage. But it turned out not popular. Imagine running code from some source on the internet on your PC. We want to disable this.

Start button > All apps > Windows Administrative tools > Component Services. Computer Servies > Computers > right click on My Computer; choose Properties. Go to Default Protocols tab. Under DCOM protocols, remove Connection oriented TCP/IP.

### Activate Windows

### Check for Updates

### Install All Software, Update Firewall Rules

### Patching
One of the most important things to do is to update EVERYTHING on your computer, constantly, that means Windows Update and updating all programs and plug-ins. It is very important to know that security patches closes the holes that malware/hackers need to get onto your computer.  Patching the security holes is the ultimate preventative measure that treats the source of the problem.


### Turn off AutoPlay
 Settings > Devices > AutoPlay, set AutoPlay to off.
 
### and AutoRun
AutoRun is the predecessor of AutoPlay, and is still active in Windows 10. Start the registry editor and go to this key:

 HKEY_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\Explorer\NoDriveTypeAutoRun
Change the value to 'FF'

### Sign on Security
It is very important to guard your sign on passphrases, espcially your admin account one. attackers will try to trick you into giving out the passphrase by installing a tojan  that looks like the Windows sign on screen and upon seeing this most users will key in their passphrase without question. Microsoft has made a feature whereby you need to press CTRL-ALT-DEL in order to reach the sign on screen,  because the special key sequence CTRL-ALT-DEL can only be trapped by the operating system. This feature is normally only active when a PC is domain joined to Windows Servers. However it can be enabled without Windows servers. 

Another MS security feature is not displaying the account name in the sign on screen, even when the user is currently signed on and has locked the system by pressing WinKey-L. This means the attacker needs to get both the account name and the passphrase right and significantly enhances security. 

### Privacy

Under Start > Settings > Privacy is a whole lot of apps that uses your private info. Some of them are used by Cortana, the new artificial intelligence personal assistant, like Speech, inking & typing, and Location. The privacy settings are per account, except Location, which is a system wide setting which can only be enabled by admins. Most privacy settings now has a system wide on/off switch, which can only be enabled by admins.

### Enable DEP
Data Execution Prevention is a technology that foils some types of attacks when they are coded in a certain way. By default, this feature is enabled but protects only Windows executables. You want to enable it to protect all programs, like your Firefox, Opera, Acrobat Reader and others.

Right Click Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Performance Settings button/ Data Execution Prevention Tab
  Select "Turn on DEP for all programs ..."
  
![alttext](https://i.imgur.com/M0IfAyy.png "dep")
  
### Disable dump file creation
Dump files are memory dumps, and everything in memory are saved to a file. This is used for debugging problems when your system crashes. However, passwords and all confidential stuff that are running currently are also saved to this file. You should enable this feature only when you are experiencing problems and need to debug.

Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Startup and Recovery Settings - settings button

Write debugging info: None.

### Disallow Remote Assistance
Remote assistance allow a helper to control your PC with complete desktop, keyboard and mouse access

### Let Windows make more Restore Points available

### Configure Lock Screen

### Sandboxing your Browser

Sandboxie ( http://www.sandboxie.com/ applies the sandbox security concept to protect any browser. Basically, the protected browser is made to look within a small directory, but it thinks that that directory is drive C. Sandboxie, and any sandbox in general, does not aim to stop an attack, but instead contains the attack, within that directory. If the attack creates folders and files, it will be created in that directory. If it installs hacking tools and malware, they will all be confined to that directory. All your downloads will also arrive into that directory first, and Sandboxie will help move it back to the outside world. And everything in that directory can be wiped away with one click. This program is vital to securing your browser.

It has been debated whether Chrome's AppContainer security is better than Sandboxie. According to one forum message, AppContainer is one level lower than Sandboxie's "untrusted" mode, and that should be a good thing.

### Passwords

You should have strong passwords to safe guard your accounts, particularly the admin accounts

### BIOS Password
 
It is also prudent to password protect your BIOS, so that people cannot boot your PC. Also, you should change the boot order in the BIOS so that it boots the hard drive first, rather than the CD/DVD. If an attacker can insert a Linux Live CD and start up your PC, then they will be able to mount your hard drive and read all data from it, and all Windows security will be bypassed.

### Physical Security

Lock your office or study room or bedroom containing your PC.

### BitLocker Drive Encryption
BitLocker is a full disk encryption feature of Windows 10 Pro, When that is active, the whole drive is encrypted and will not be readable with other copies of Windows or Linux. This eliminates the offline attacks

### Intrusion Detection
Windows’ Event Viewer holds a lot of information about your system (Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Event Viewer). One cannot claim to know what is going on in a system without examining the logs periodically.

Intrusion detection also has to do with seeing that things aren’t different from what is normal. Your PC was running perfectly on day 1 after hardening, is it doing anything different today? To answer that question, we need baselines.

What we want to know is what programs are normally running when we first login. If we know that, then we can be sure that we aren’t contaminated with spyware or other hacking tools. There are 2 programs we want to get, all free. The first one is **AutoRuns**, available from here: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902
AutoRuns lists all of the places in the registry where programs are set to auto launch. Right click on it, and choose Run as admin, and use File/Save to take a snapshot of each account's current settings. Later on during your regular system checkups, you can use the File/Compare feature to see if anything is different. New entries show up in green. If all green entries are good, then save the file again with todays date, and do the comparison with the new file in the next scheduled check.

The second program is **Process Explorer**, available here: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653

This program is like Task Manager, but it shows more info. Many malware name themselves with familiar Windows program names, trying to hide themselves. Login to your admin account, then right click on Process Manager and choose 'run as admin', go to View/Select Columns and checkmark 'command line'. Then do a File/Save . The resulting text file is now a snapshot of what normally runs when you first login.

```
netstat -abn > netstat-baseline.txt
```

The netstat program shows you a list of programs that are listening and connecting to the net. If a attacker connects to your PC, his program would have to connect back from your PC to his PC, and his program would show up here in this list.

Driverquery is a command line tool in Windows, What it does is list all the drivers in use. Some virus and rootkits now come in the form of a driver. When you perform you routine checks, first run this:
```
driverquery > out.txt
```
If this is the first snapshot, then rename the out.txt to driverquery-out.txt.

Next time, run this:
```
driverquery > out2.txt
```
Then use Beyond Compare to compare the original against the new one.

The thing to do is to create a first txt, then create a 2nd txt just before you do each Windows Update, and use Beyond Compare to see if there are any diffferences. If there are, investigate, because nothing should have changed unless you installed new software, or that someone has added something to your machine in between the last Windows Update till now. That would be around 2 weeks, and most changes should be still fresh in your mind.

If there are no difference, do the Windows Update and create another set of baselines.

Now we have 4 baselines, save them onto a USB memory stick for use in comparisons later. One should also save the Autoruns, and Process Explorer files onto the memory stick as well. Because, after an attack, programs may get altered or rendered unusable You Have to keep the baselines on a USB memory stick because attackers will modify your baselines to make you think nothing has changed.

Last thing when doing baseline comparisons is to run “sfc /scannow” to determine if any system files has been modified. SFC contains the correct windows files signatures and makes a comparison to the current setup.

You should definitely install antivirus and antispyware programs. However note, you can only have one realtime antivirus program

For a list of antivirus programs to consider, go to http://av-comparitives.orgor http://virusbtn.com. These 2 sites run test on antivirus programs to see how effective they are..

There are also a lot of fake antivirus programs floating around, so make sure you find more than 1 review before installing one

Bear in mind that no antivirus/anti-spyware program will catch everything you encounter. 
. To be on the safe side, use online scanners once in a while to do a double check. There are quite a few of them: TrendMicro Housecall, BitDefender, Kapersky, Panda and ESET. Google for "online scan" and you will see them.

There is a program called **WinDump**, from here: http://www.winpcap.org/windump. It can capture all network traffic. And if you run it on another non-compromised machine, it can tell you almost absolutely if you have been attacked because you are looking at the network traffic from the outside of the compromised machine, and no rootkit can hide their traffic.

A **Honey Pot** is usually a unused dummy system set up just to lure attackers. Once you notice traffic on it, then it is guarenteed that you have an attacker. You can setup auditing for a 'honey folder' which you never click on to act as an intrusion detector.

First create a folder, called for example 'Plans for the New year', and then right click on it and choose Properties. Then go to Security tab > Advanced > Audit tab. First you set up which user account to watch for, then leave the settings for 'Read and Execute' which will generate an Event Viewer entry

**Anti-Keylogers** Zemana AntiLogger. (http://www.zemana.com) which has anti-keylogger as well as anti-screen grabber functions. The other one is KeyScrambler (http://www.qfxsoftware.comm) which is only a anti-keylogger. ( Both programs now have free editions.)

# Security is a process, that is ongoing after we perform hardening.
Your hardened Windows Windows 10 is good and now has multiple layers of security, but new vulnerabilities will be discovered in various software that you use and weaken your stance. Take the case of the browser; attackers target browsers all the time, and new security holes will be revealed. One has to know when these holes are discovered, and take steps to mitigate.

The first step is to know about the new vulnerabilities. The following websites report on security matters ::

http://threatpost.comm

http://www.theregister.co.uk/security//

You should visit them once a week to learn of new security vulnerabilities. The articles will tell you about new security holes in applications or OS, which version it applies to, and give a brief description of the weakness. Sometimes, the software vendor will inform us of some configuration change for you to apply for the time being, until they make a patch ready. Also, the articles may tell us if attacks using the vulnerability has been spotted in use..
